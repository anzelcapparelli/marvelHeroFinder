## Description

The following code would create a page site that allows the user to enter a Marvel comic character. They can click the buttons with character names to search up any previously searched up characters or they can enter a character in the search bar.

Searching up a character brings out their profile. This should include a name, profile picture, stats radar chart, description, and GIPHY images. There is a also a link to the character Marvel Wikia page.
